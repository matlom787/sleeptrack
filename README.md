-Goals of the Project-

The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly sleep tracking application that enables users to:
  -Log their sleep and wake times for accurate tracking of sleep duration.
  -Visualize progress with a bonsai tree that grows as the user logs consistent sleep data.
  -View their total sleep time in a readable format for self-monitoring and improvement.
  -This app is designed to help users improve their sleep hygiene while gamifying the process with visual incentives.


-Functionalities-

The application includes the following functionalities:

1. Sleep and Wake Time Logging:
  -Users can select their sleep and wake times using a date and time picker.
  -Sleep durations are calculated and displayed in a formatted text output.
2. Sleep Duration Display:
  -A UILabel dynamically updates to display the calculated sleep duration in hours and minutes.
3. Bonsai Tree Growth:
  -A bonsai tree image grows in stages as users consistently log sleep records.
  -The tree resets to the initial stage when the app restarts.
4. Persistent Storage:
  -The application saves growth progress and sleep records using UserDefaults to ensure data continuity.


-Architecture and Design-

Model-View-Controller:
  The project follows the MVC architecture to separate the logic, user interface, and data management:
  Model: Handles persistent storage (UserDefaults) and sleep data calculations.
  View: Includes UILabel, UIDatePicker, and UIImageView for user interaction and display.
  Controller: Manages user inputs, updates UI elements, and links data logic with the interface.
Key Components:
  -View Controller: SleepTrackerViewController.swift handles user interaction and manages sleep tracking logic.
  -Storyboard: Provides a user interface with visually connected outlets and actions.
