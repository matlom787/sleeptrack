<h1>Goals of the Project</h1>

The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly sleep tracking application that enables users to:

  -Log their sleep and wake times for accurate tracking of sleep duration.
  
  -Visualize progress with a bonsai tree that grows as the user logs consistent sleep data.
  
  -View their total sleep time in a readable format for self-monitoring and improvement.
  
  -This app is designed to help users improve their sleep hygiene while gamifying the process with visual incentives.


<h1>Functionalities</h1>

The application includes the following functionalities:

1. Sleep and Wake Time Logging:
   
  -Users can select their sleep and wake times using a date and time picker.
  
  -Sleep durations are calculated and displayed in a formatted text output.
  
2. Sleep Duration Display:
   
  -A UILabel dynamically updates to display the calculated sleep duration in hours and minutes.
  
3. Bonsai Tree Growth:
   
  -A bonsai tree image grows in stages as users consistently log sleep records.
  
  -The tree resets to the initial stage when the app restarts.

4. Persistent Storage:
   
  -The application saves growth progress and sleep records using UserDefaults to ensure data continuity.


<h1>Architecture and Design</h1>

<h3>Model-View-Controller:</h3>

  The project follows the MVC architecture to separate the logic, user interface, and data management:
  
  Model: Handles persistent storage (UserDefaults) and sleep data calculations.
  
  View: Includes UILabel, UIDatePicker, and UIImageView for user interaction and display.
  
  Controller: Manages user inputs, updates UI elements, and links data logic with the interface.
  
<h3>Key Components:</h3>

  View Controller: SleepTrackerViewController.swift handles user interaction and manages sleep tracking logic.
  
  Storyboard: Provides a user interface with visually connected outlets and actions.
